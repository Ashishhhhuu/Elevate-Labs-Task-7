Sales Data Analysis using SQLite & Python
This project demonstrates how to perform basic sales data analysis using SQLite and Python within a Jupyter Notebook. It includes database creation, data insertion, SQL queries for insights, and data visualization using matplotlib.

üß∞ Tools Used
Python

SQLite (sqlite3)

Jupyter Notebook

pandas

matplotlib

üìÅ Project Overview
The project simulates a basic retail sales environment by:

Creating a local SQLite database

Storing sample sales data

Running SQL queries to extract insights such as:

Total revenue per product

Total quantity sold

Average price per product

Visualizing these insights using bar charts

‚úÖ Steps Performed
1. Library Imports
The project starts by importing the necessary libraries for database handling, data manipulation, and visualization.

2. Database Creation
A new SQLite database file (sales_data.db) is created and a connection is established using sqlite3.

3. Table Setup
A table named sales is created with the following fields:

id (Primary Key)

product (Product name)

quantity (Units sold)

price (Price per unit)

4. Data Insertion
A sample dataset containing multiple entries for products like Apple, Banana, Orange, and Grapes is inserted into the database.

5. Query: Total Quantity & Revenue
An SQL query is executed to calculate:

Total quantity sold (SUM(quantity))

Total revenue (SUM(quantity * price))
Grouped by product.

6. Visualization: Revenue by Product
A bar chart is created to visualize the total revenue for each product.

7. Query: Total Quantity Sold
A second SQL query calculates the total quantity sold per product, which is also visualized using a bar chart.

8. Query: Average Price
A third SQL query calculates the average price of each product using AVG(price) and displays the results.

üìä Output
Sales Summary Table: Product-wise total quantity and revenue

Bar Chart: Revenue by product

Total Quantity Chart: Visual representation of product sales volume

Average Price Table: Mean price of each product
